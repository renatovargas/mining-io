# Introduction

In this session, we develop input-output analysis frameworks for the mining sector of Brazil, Chile, Peru, and South Africa. During the first analysis phase, we run employment and value added multipliers for value-added and employment. Ultimately, our objective is to disaggregate the matrices regionally and to separate the information from a single company from the rest of the input-output matrix.

## Preamble

We first clean the workspace and call the appropriate libraries.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: libraries

# Clean workspace
rm(list = ls())

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
```

## Datasets

We identify data files.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: datasets-files

xlsx-files <- c("data/PER/PER_IO_Framework.xlsx")
```
